## Price Regression Analysis for Early Stage Trailer Start-up

## Overview

This project involved conducting a price regression analysis for an anonymous early stage trailer start-up. The goal was to guide pricing for a base trailer without added features. We used machine learning techniques to predict the appropriate price point based on various features.
Project Details

The project involved the following steps:

    Data collection
    Data preprocessing and cleaning
    Feature engineering (currently in progress)
    Machine learning model development and evaluation
    Price prediction for the base trailer

I am currently working on feature engineering to improve the accuracy of our model.

## Technologies Used

    Python
    Pandas
    Scikit-learn

## Files

    trailerdata1.csv: Raw data for the project
    trailer-price-regression.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the machine learning model development and evaluation

## Results

This machine learning model has shown promising results and I am confident that it will guide the start-up in setting the right price for their base trailer.
